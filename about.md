## About Me

I'm an engineer at Dell Technologies, working in the Client Office of the CTO. I spend my time prototyping new products, working directly with customers, and turning ideas into shipping software.

## The Journey

I joined Dell in 2017, starting on Edge IoT back when "edge computing" was still a pitch deck buzzword. I stayed because I kept finding interesting problems to solve.

**Early days: Edge & Classical ML**  
My first few years were spent showcasing what GPU workstations could do — classical AI/ML use cases that proved the hardware could handle real workloads. This was before the LLM explosion, when getting a model to run efficiently on local hardware was still a hard problem.

**Design thinking detour**  
I spent time working alongside Dell's end-user experience designers, including a month at our Amsterdam design office. This changed how I think about building things. I learned that the experience of using a product matters as much as the technology behind it. I became the "software arm" for design teams — taking their concepts and building working prototypes.

**Back to the deep end: Telemetry & MLOps**  
I wanted real engineering experience, not just prototypes. I joined the Dell Telemetry Platforms team, working in Databricks and on-prem data warehousing. Terabytes of data flowing daily, ML models making business decisions downstream. I stood up MLOps processes and learned what it takes to run systems at scale.

**Accelerator: Startup-style innovation**  
I started the Software Accelerator team — a small group that takes an agile approach to internal innovation. Tight loops, 12-week sprints from idea to beta. We built **Dell Pro AI Studio**, an AI orchestration platform that lets enterprises deploy models across iNPU, dNPU, iGPU, dGPU, AI companion devices, edge, private cloud, and public cloud. It shipped and is now part of Dell's AI PC strategy.

**Today: Customer-facing AI**  
Now I work directly with Dell's customers, helping them bring AI from concept to reality. Classical ML, computer vision, agentic AI on client hardware — whatever the problem, I help figure out the path from "we want to do AI" to "it's running in production."

## What I Care About

**Local AI.** I believe the future isn't everything in the cloud — it's powerful models running on hardware you own. Privacy, latency, control.

**Design + Engineering.** The best products come from people who understand both. I've sat in design studios and written production code. That perspective matters.

**Building things that ship.** Prototypes are fun, but I measure success by what makes it to customers.
